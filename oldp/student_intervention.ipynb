    "The decision to use KNeighborsClassifier was mostly due to its low cost computationally. Given a battery of\n",
    "possible tuning parameters it was the only one of the algorithms that was feasably tunable given low resources.\n",
    "It performed better than other cheap alternatives like Naive Bayes, so it was reasonably\n",
    "well performing for its cost. As seen in the benchmark table in cell [82] out of the box it was outperformed only\n",
    "by the SVC, which is more costly to train. Still its improvement after tuning was only marginal. \n",

    "**Layman Explanation: KNeighborsClassifier**  \n",

    "The mechanism with which our model decides whether a current student will pass or fail is very intuitive. Each student has 30 attributes\n",
    "associated with him/her. These range from basic descriptors like their age, sex, and health, to behavioral descriptors like whether they are in\n",
    "a romantic relationship, how much time they devote to study, if they have any extra curricular activities. Some of the attributes are of things\n",
    "out of there control like whether they have internet access, the size of their family, and what neighborhood they live in. What are model\n",
    "process does, is that it assigns a relevant number to every one of these attributes. Just like for example you can take a house and assign it a\n",
    "longitude, a latitude, and maybe if it sits on a hill an altitude. In the same way that information like longitude, latitude and altitude,\n",
    "alows us to decide how far away two houses are from each other, we can decide how \"far away\" two particular students are from each other. Based\n",
    "on all those attributes like free time and age and so forth. Since we have information about which students have failed and which have passed,\n",
    "our model basically answers the question; how \"close\" is this student to other students who have passed. Maybe he is \"closer\" to students who\n",
    "fail. We can choose to compare him/her to the closest _single_ student to determine how likely he is to pass or fail. Usually, however we tune\n",
    "the model to find a _group_ of students closest to him/her, maybe the closest 4 students, or maybe 10 closest students. The exact number is\n",
    "determined while tuning. Since we use students that we know either passed or failed in this group, we can determine if our student in question\n",
